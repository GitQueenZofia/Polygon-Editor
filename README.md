Polygon Editor
This project is a polygon editor that allows users to add and edit polygons. 

Editing features: 
- Moving vertices
- Deleting vertices
- Adding vertices in the middle of selected edges
- Moving edges
- Changing edge width
- Moving entire polygons
- Horizontal or vertocal edge constraint (Adjacent edges cannot both be vertical or horizontal)
Adding or removing a vertex on an edge removes constraints from adjacent edges!

Visualisation:
- Displaying icons indicating applied constraints at the midpoint of edges
- Offset polygon with a positive offset value

Drawing Lines:
- Library algorithm
- Bresenham's algorithm
- Symmetric Bresenham's algorithm

Manual:
- To add a new polygon click "Draw polygon"
- To edit vertices/edges click "Select"
- To move a vertex or an edge right-click on it and then drag
- To add constraint/delete/change width, left-click on that object and click specific button
